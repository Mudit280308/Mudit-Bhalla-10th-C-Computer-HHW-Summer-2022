            Chhole Bhature - The Best Street Food in Delhi (Source)
            Riding on high on reviews that can even put 5-star restaurants to shame, Chache di Hatti is one of the oldest joints in the heart of the north campus of Delhi University. They are known for serving the best chole bhature in Delhi University's North Campus. Stuffed, melt-in-mouth bhaturas with optimally spiced chhole and special pickled salad is gonna make you go mmmm.  But one has to wait for a while here to be served, sometimes as long as an hour to get their own slice of heaven. Make sure to make a dash for this Delhi street food joint, for they sell out every day by noon!

            Stereotypes are not restricted to people but also to food. If you are a Delhi street food enthusiast with an ironical knack for hygiene, look no further. Prince Paan serves an array of paan flavours like Butterscotch Paan, Strawberry Paan and even Paan ki Chaat! As for those obsessed with hygiene, they even serve Gol Gappe made in mineral water! Don't miss their nimbu masala paan which is a raging hit among their regulars.

            Shopping in the buzzing marketplace of Karol Bagh is incomplete without the quintessential lunch at Roshan ki Kulfi. The speciality of the outlet is, no points for guessing, the kulfi-faluda, which is particularly a respite in the blistering and intolerable heat of Delhi. It serves one of the best kulfis in Delhi. Another Delhi staple of chhole bhature with a long tumbler of lassi is what has all the customers smacking their lips.

            Location: 2816, Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi

            Shawarma lovers, did you think we'd leave you stranded? With service faster than the speed of light and yet uncompromising on quality and light on the pocket, Spice Aangan leaves meat lovers asking for more. Melt in mouth meat, oozing with juices and flavours, the shawarma rolls are a departure from tradition, served with mayonnaise and green chutney, but that only adds to their charm. You're sure to keep coming back for more, all the regulars do!
            
            Open Timings: 11:00 AM - 11:00 PM

            The name itself suggests the heritage linked to this place. Khadani Pakodewala is one of the Delhi street food joints where the quality of the food has not degraded with time. The crispy batter covering with the soft filling is still as scrumptious as before. Apart from the common potato, cauliflower and onion pakoras, they're also made from paneer, baby corn and lotus stem too. For regulars, Khandani is akin to a foodie's must-stop on their way to or from Sarojini Nagar.
